### Notes

- This task list is designed to be processed sequentially.
- Each parent task builds on the previous ones, so it's important to complete them in order.
- Use `pytest` to run all tests from the root directory.
- The automated pipeline will be triggered by the Stagehand MCP Server in production.
- For local development and testing, manual triggering will be used.
