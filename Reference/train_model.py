# ==============================================================================
# MSTR Stock Price Forecaster - Model Training Script
# ==============================================================================
#
# Description:
# This script performs the following actions:
#   1. Loads the historical MSTR stock and Bitcoin price data from a CSV file.
#   2. Cleans the data by selecting relevant columns and removing any rows with
#      missing information.
#   3. Trains a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict
#      the MSTR closing price based on Bitcoin's price and the M-NAV.
#   4. Prints the final model coefficients (intercept, btc_price_coeff, m_nav_coeff)
#      which are required for the frontend calculator's JavaScript.
#   5. As a best practice, it also performs a validation check by splitting the
#      data to calculate the model's R-squared and Mean Absolute Error,
#      providing insight into its accuracy on historical data.
#
# Usage:
#   - Ensure 'input_file_0.csv' is in the same directory as this script.
#   - Run from the command line: python train_model.py
